I’m the District Duppy Hunter Controller. 

What is a Duppy? A Duppy in Ingland you would say ghost, but we from Caribbean know them as spirit. 

There are different types – resting, trapped but the ones we hunt are the walking duppy. 

These restless ras-cals cross over and possess humans in order to bring chaos to the world. 

A walking duppy has been detected in this area. Now soon I will match you with a Duppy Hunter and your job willl be to support them in finding the duppy. 

Are you ready to help us find the duppy? 

If so look at your phone and let me know and push the button to get going.

Good. 

Now lemme mek sure you prepared. Phone charged? Water, fish food and salt inna ya hand? Walking shoes?  This isn’t the time for stilettos – you might have to run from the duppy. 

From time to time you might have to look at your phone to inform me or the Hunter, so if there is a sound or mi gone quite then check you phone and let me know you alright. 

There might be some choices you have to make so when I ask you to, take out your phone and choose the best option so we don’t lose our way.

Alright I need to make sure you are mentally and physically ready to Duppy Hunt. 

First the physical. 

Put your arms out in front of you and on a count of three I want you to inhale. Push your elbows back, clench your hands into a fist and then punch forward. Ready. 1,2,3. Do that three times. Good.  

Now for the mental. 

Say out loud:  

I am a duppy hunter. 

Louder. I am a duppy hunter 

Louder. I am a duppy hunter. 

Good – you can’t be timid. Now I’ve matched you with one of our finest duppy hunters. You will be her eyes, ears, hands, and yes that means you will conquer the duppy.  

You ready? 

Look at your phone and let me know.

Alright controller, I’ve got this now.  

Can you see anyone? Anything strange. Take your time look, in every corner. 

Scan the trees – you never know some duppy can climb. Behind you! 

Hmm that’s not a strong signal. Maybe it’s sleeping... 

What’s in the corner? the far corner... to the right at the back of the garden? Take, a look – be careful.

Trinity Hall. Trinity Centre. I knew it looked familiar. This is where I first saw them.  I was playing outside among the graves - back then this garden was a graveyard. It was Sunday, 77 or 78, Dad and his friends were inside converting the Church into a community centre.  

...

I saw them, some sitting, some rocking, some walking back and forth. Couples, friends, together	and alone.  

Fine black lace, top hats, cloth caps and waistcoats. Duppy elders who came back to listen to the echo of a hymn.  

//All things bright and beautiful.  
All creatures great and small 
All things wise and wonderful,  
the Lord God made them all.//

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
One of the last songs sung here before it closed in 76. 

I was so scared but Mumma let me into a secret. I was a obeah woman from a long line of obeah woman born with the power to-  

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
to see and conquer duppies.  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
I was going to say that. Controller why are you still here? 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
Cause your rusty.  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Not as much as you. You so rusty you spirit smell like iron. I’ve got this. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
I’ll be making sure ‘yu have it.’ It’s been a while since you did a hunt after-all.  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Sorry friend, can I call you friend? Sorry for the arguments – the Controller is my mother. She’s got issues.

The one you looking for. You and the Controller too slow. I’m over by Newfoundland Road before the roundabout talking to a good shepherd, right outside the home of a saint.

c) In the lodge about to start a meeting

From the youngest to the eldest and in-between. 

I going to make them mine and then I can change anytime. 

And no Duppy Hunter can catch me.

Friend. We have to catch this duppy. St Paul’s means everything to me. It was one of the six wards I watched over. It’s where I was born and raised until I retired. But I had to answer the Controller’s call. I cannot have a duppy walking through my St Paul’s.

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>	
Like I was telling you. 

That’s the women who took over the vicarage when the Church was closing. It was a sanctuary from violence. Because I’m here you are hearing the echo memory of the past. It’s like layers, layers of sound. 

<span class="char-name">Young Josie:</span>
My island like  
a swimming turtle  
surfaces in the fish tank 
Of the Television	 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>	
There’s the Old Library where I first fell in love with Caribbean writers who brought Mumma & 		Daddy’s island stories to life. 

So, I was saying when I first saw the duppies I thought they were shadows. They didn’t pay any attention to me but there was one... a tall bone white man with a long face wearing a long Black cloak he pointed this gnarly twig of a finger at me and told me to come closer. 

He smiled – perfect white teeth - opened his hand and in his palm was a ghost white doll, black eyes, black hair, black gown. 

I was about to take it until I looked into his eyes, like a wolf eating prey. I screamed and called for Mumma.  

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>	
“Never take anything them offer you”

You understand. Never. 

If you’d taken that doll that duppy would have entered you.  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>	
And someone has.  

Someone has taken a gift from a duppy and now the duppy walks the streets. 
The duppy will want to enter as many hosts as possible. Every time it passes through a new host it becomes more powerful.  When it has possessed you it can make you do anything. 
Salt is the weapon we use to put the duppy to rest – to conquer it – as we obeah women say.   

 
<span class="char-name">Amelia Dyer:</span>	
Got yourself into trouble. Need a hand?  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>	
Amelia Dyer – the killer. Her duppy as evil as when she lived.  

We have bound her here for eternity. She keeps trying but she’ll never become a walking duppy.  

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
Turn right onto Stapleton road - pass Nadines and Maliks. 

Once you pass Maliks, it’ll be on the opposite side of the road, don’t cross just yet. Let me know you reached and just wait there for a moment.

Now you can get any kind of Caribbean, African or Asian food in England now, but back then Mum said she had to make do with what she could find. 

Stapleton Road was very different when Mumma first came over.

That will be the children of St Nicolas of Tolentine. The Catholic school. 

Huh from Irish Catholic, West Indian to East African and Muslim in no time. ‘Trusted by all the community’ from the youngest to the eldest and everybody in-between.  

The duppy could step into a child.  

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>	
Look across the street to your left at the green fronted convenience store. Turn to your right and see the green and yellow front of Nadine’s Caribbean Cafe. 

Let me know you can see it and just stay there for a moment.

Look over the side of the bridge. We’re crossing the Danny that’s what we call her, the river,but we should honor her original Celtic name – Frome. She’s been buried, dragged, shut and sent from one part of the city to the other but still she flows.

Done? 
Right back on the path now and walk through the park towards the M32 bridge.  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
This is where I would meet my friends. 

Crossing the Danny, a rite of passage. Not for me but for the friends who either didn’t live in Paul’s or who’s parents didn’t like Paul’s. They thought it was full of crime. But I grew up in St Paul’s, it was a village with every walk of life.

This is Riverside Park, this green between the motor way bridge and the Peel Street. 

But where’s the assault course? 

There were bars and climbing frames. A wire. It’s gone. I slipped and fell and broke my arm on the ropes one year.

<span class="char-name">Hadrian:</span>
‘You're young: you’ll heal.’

Walk across M32 Bridge. And let me know when you are at the end of the bridge.

Newfoundland Road. I remember there were offices on the corner. Community organizations. After the Uprising. A choir. Empty.

Last time I come to Newfoundland was to cut a new set of keys at the DIY shop. 

The shop should be here. Blue and brown.

The red lodge where classes and meetings are kept
Of course the shepherd must be a priest outside St Agnes Church – the stone tower.

Don’t be scared.
Say ‘I am a duppy hunter.’ If you have anybody with you say it to them too and lock arms. The duppy can’t harm you as long as I’m with you. 
Where are you Duppy? Friend, have a look round the side, 
No sign. 
Nothing from the duppy Detector.
What if he’s taken the priest ?

Davey Street. Where I grew up. Rice and peas on Sunday mornings church women with wide starched dresses and stiff hats, matching 
Is that a banana tree – that’s new.
I called it sweetie Street because of the pastel-colored houses. Summer playing out in the street, chalks, jumping rope, biking round Paul's. My first crush lives along here somewhere. Big Afro. Back then.
Last Carnival As it Is TV – a Soundsystem played along here- I’m told. 
Did you go, friend? I didn’t. Haven’t been for years – always some thing comes up. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
I like these clothes these young people wear. What you call it 
A-di-rass? He he. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
When I ketch you. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
I met a young ram on Davey who’s fast like Donovan Bailey
We are off to meet his sweetheart. Mi want her for new start.  
I’ll be over at a place on St Nicholas Street. 
I’ll hanging either by

The Falafel Palais
The Big Palm Tree
Good Jim’s Magnolia Inn

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
What? Is this thing working? The Duppy Detector. How come he’s sneaking up on us. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
He might have some kind of Duppy Detector blocker. You can’t concern yourself with that. You have to find him. We don’t know what craziness he’s caused when he was inside the priest, now 		he’s inside the young man and about to cause more damage. We have to find him before he get’s 		to the woman.
Walk down Davey Street, until you are standing on the corner of St Nicholas Street. Let me know when you reach. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
St Nicolas Street for me was the home of Ms Wynter her family and Tinker man. Mrs Wynter a small, light big spirit loving woman. Tinker Man. Fix anything for nothing.

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
We got it.

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
St Nicholas House – the old pub owned by Mr Jim Williams Bristol’s first Black civic Mayor. 
Be careful. Salt ready. 
Look outside is there anyone there? Look around the side. Nobody.


<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
The duppy detector is just picking up the sounds of peaceful duppies. But just hit that button to let us know that you are still alert, eyes and ears wide for that Duppy! 
￼
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Not what we’re after.
Hmm  
Is it still open? No definitely not. It was Mr Williams pub. Jim Williams. The first Black civic Mayor. Dad’s favorite drinking spot after he finished working at Trinity. I’d slip inside and take it all in. 

<span class="char-name">Hadrian:</span>
Hadrian:	‘Tek dat yu brute.’ 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
When I wanted more pocket money I would visit Dad in the pub. 
All his friend’s would give me change as well. Rum and whiskey made them generous. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
Duppy where yu dey?

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Wey you dey?

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
You took so long I moved on. That boy’s sweetheart is a real outlaw he he. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Leave her be you dutty duppy. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
You want to stop me? Let’s duel like old days for the young lady. 
By the green where St Nicholas and Grosvenor Road meet.
Find the Sankofa bird and you find me. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
The Sankofa bird – the bird that looks forward and back in time. In Sr Paul’s. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
Why not. Stranger things have happened. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
No think. It’s a trick. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
While you disagree its more time for me to get into a new body.
Now where could tweety tweety Sankofa be. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
It’s that time again, remember to choose the right one. You are almost there. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
The Sankofa bird facing where the doves once danced
In front of the Elderly
Who draws first a soul will keep. Want to know where I’ll be 
Better rush cause dis duppy nah sleep
  
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Deal. You’re going back to shadow. 
 
<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span>
We’ll see. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Where do you think he means, the green?

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
Walk straight St Nicholas Street. Carefully cross Ludlow Road and you will be facing a Green. Walk along the path through the green till you reach the centre.

Yes, on the wall between glass, wood and concrete the Learning Centre.Can you see the image of the bird inset on the wall above the glass window. 
 
And the window where the hungry fill dem belly must be Glen’s Caribbean restaurant. 
            
Great but where is this duppy?

St Nicholas Street, Grosvenor Road, I haven’t walked around here for years. St Nick’s is where I met the Father of the boys. I was at this night called La Boom. Very popular. Me and the night. African, soul, reggae, everything. He came over big teet smiling and funky, short, dreads and started making fun of my dancing I could have slapped him but he made me laugh. 
 
After La Boom we went to Crystal Dove. 
 
Look straight ahead. It used to be in front of us on the green. Like a scout hut. Smaller. No bigger than a living room. Packed on weekends. We couldn’t move. Didn’t want to. Boy he could whine. If it wasn’t for that whine.

Friend, you ever lose you head cause of a good whine?
Of course - the dove in front of the elderly Crystal Dove was opposite, roughly, the day centre 	set up by Olive Osborne. Boy that was just one of the things she did, sewing classes, youth 	groups, community organisations a real Woman King. 
 
The window where the hungry fill their belly -Glen’s the singing chef. His new place. He’s a  pioneer of Caribbean food.

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
From here you could smell Carnival happening. The Afrikan Caribbean Carnival. 
When I was younger it was all about Sound System- Bastian, Tarzan, Wild Bunch, Maasai Warrior every street vibrating with bass. Hip hop, dub, dancehall, reggae, Soca.
 
<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
Not enough soca and too much slackness. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
You still here. 
This Green was the main stage, - Jonny Osbourne, Black Roots, Talisman local and outer-	national bands. Can’t rave at Carnival the same way once you have kids- their not catching me whining up in batty riders. I’d hang out with other big People once they got older.

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
 
Toy Boy sounds on the corner of St Nick’s street.
  
Carnival was our Black Pride moment. Every shade every kind of us together.
 
I felt safe here in St Paul’s. Step outside – Centre, South Bristol, Horfield, even as kids you could be spat at, called names.‘Sambo, nig nog, the N word.’ Chased by men older than your 	Father. Madness.

They wouldn’t come into our streets and say that. They wouldn’t dare.

But the Beasts would. They would come in their Beast wagons, prey on people like vultures.

Duppy attack. Can you see where that came from. Get the salt ready.

I thought you said it was a duel.
 
<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span> 
Doesn’t mean I’m going to tell you I’m coming.
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Come out. 

Player get the salt ready. 
 
<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span> 
Too late duel done, I’ve won and gone. 
Now the young lady sharpshooter has a friend,
Full up a story but he can’t talk to anybody.  
He’s not moved since him was a baby
All him eat and drink come from the nature 
Him so stiff Samson can’t shift him
All him do is watch and listen
What a ting if I could have him walking and talking.
Right now he’s living on the Frontline. 

<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span> 
By Frontline you’ll find this watcher of reality. He he. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Duppy! Hmm well we know he’s on Frontline. Frontline isn’t a street it’s a reality, a way of life, where all roads meet. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Safely cross over Grosvenor road and turn right down Grosvenor Road until you reach Grosvenor Road triangle park on your left. You know it, let me know once you reach.

This time of day there would be all kinds of people passing by on their way here and there.

St Paul’s was our Black Bristol capital and Grosvenor Road, was the heart.

Butchers, tailors, the Motor Bike shop, I remember the Lloyds, where Mumma used to go to deposit 	her duppy hunting savings, the Post Office. It was where you did you’re shopping -food, 	hair, curtains 	where you saw the latest fashions, long skirt, short skirt, red, gold and green tams leather jackets. 	It was 	the first time I saw a Rasta. A cool tall dread in a khaki suit, leaning up against a wall smoking. A rebel. 
 
But the Beast Master never liked rebels. 
 
It would not leave us alone. Neither me nor Mum could stop them. Not all of them.

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Continue to the end of Grosvenor Road until it meets with Ashley Road. On the corner of the triangle turn left back onto Ashley Road walking down the side of the triangle. At the entrance to the triangle head down the path.

A playwright one of the first from the Caribbean. Alfred lived in St Paul’s. He was one of Dad’s 	friends. 	Alfred moved to London but had a heart attack and died when he was out jogging. When the beasts found 	him, they thought he was a vagrant and gave him a pauper’s funeral until friend’s realised, he’d gone missing and gave him a proper burial. 

To see a great man buried like he was nothing. On the street. 

Dad said You were like Alfred. The way you dreamed out loud. 
Why here? Why has the Duppy brought me here. No Duppy wants to enter a statute.

Oh of course Josie.
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
No, I have to stay. I have to listen. 
It began with the café on the Black and White Café. I don’t know the details. I just remember seeing 	the the Beasts, tight faces and grimacing. Joining in. Feeling mad and high. 
Bricks flying, Fire, twisted faces on both sides. All of us on fire. 
 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Something was set free that night. Duppies came, the worst kind, the wicked in life. They took advantage of the anger. A curtain, a bottle of rum, a shirt, they tainted whatever they could with their energy. The people that were tricked became hosts and the duppies pushed their rage. The duppies did the same to the officers - filled them with anger and shame.  They’d been humiliated by people they their master had told them were scum. 
 
Mumma went out to conquer as many duppies as she could but there were too many spreading 			between the Beasts and our community.
 
The Beasts came back years later. They wanted revenge. Some of us were ready.

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
I went home as the Barclays went up in flames.  
There was nothing I could do.

At the centre of Ashley Road there is an X where every voice can be heard. This X believed in self-defence, while his brother preached non-violence.  

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span>
Who is the leader who preached self-defence while his brother preached non-violence? 

Do you know? 

Well at least we know this X is on Ashley Road. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>
At the statue, turn right and follow the path back to Ashley Road. 
Turn left and continue down Ashley Road past the Owen Henry mural.

Take a left and walk into the carpark entrance and face the entrance. I just want to see the space again. 
It's where the committees I sat on used to meet even after we moved out.

It’s where the boys’ Dad used to play chess.

It took a while for it to be used, as many of us were unhappy with the building, it wasn’t 	what 	we planned. But still it became one of our most loved places in the end.

It’s closed. Locked up. 

Ajax was named after it’s owner. Businessman, hard man, entertainer, Don Juan, – a pied piper of pleasure. A café, Shady Grove, on one side and a shebeen we say shubs, below. Different from blues parties. A permanent venueEvery one went no questions, no judgment, - teenagers, office people, some white people, hippies, prostitutes, bad man, big people, everybody. Duppies loved it. Every duppy could find their reflection in someone there.

Samaritan, Bangy, was a wake up call. Strangers coming into Paul’s like kings. It could never 	happen 	before. It wasn’t just outsiders. Hustling the poppy, the pipe- took them into the Beast Master’s pit. They saw opportunity in innocence. 

You couldn’t keep Blues, you couldn’t keep Shubs anymore you didn’t know who was coming through. 

Ajax’s was the last shubs. The shubs that felt safe.

On a corner of a bridge

Big C or little c -not for me to say.  
Come find me.

I didn’t abandon St Paul’s. 

I just wanted to keep the boys safe growing up. Times had changed. The Beast Master just didn’t care about our children, our elders. The Beast Master was dropping every soul in St Paul’s. 

So, we brought the house in Fishponds. but I should have nown better. I did all the paperwork; all he did was sign his name. Except we didn’t... I did. The boy Father Simon kept coming down here. Not like me, visiting, committees, shopping. He couldn’t leave. His head was here, with his old friends. It could have been different if he had worked with me to build a different life for the boys instead, they followed him. I couldn’t forgive im. 

I can’t use Power to protect all the time and boys they get to an age where they don’t listen.

City Road. Quiet now. Families I knew along here. This is where Mumma and Dad first lived when they came to Bristol. 10 to a room Dad said when they first came here in the 50s. 
 
<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span>  
No Blacks, Dogs and Irish and she took down her sign till I use obeah to turn her. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Even with that. They said it was adventurous, They were young, they had hope, they had style. The old ways were still here though. Mumma said she and friends would keep up a kumina, that’s an African blessing, in one of the houses. 

What’s that? On the wall. Look to your left. Can you see it – is that on the corner of Denbigh Street, on the end of terrace wall. The green and stars of Jamaica. The giant grey ship, passengers reading. The Windrush.

‘Colonization in reverse’ Mumma said borrowing from her favorite poet Louise Bennett. 

I hope murals aren’t going to be all that’s left of us.
 
As long as Carnival still comes through this street, we’ll be a living force here.

Docklands. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Docklands we called it but it’s proper name is the St Paul’s Settlement. Been here since 1927 but built in 1953. Generations of young people came here – they still do. I came here as a child. I was good at netball when I wasn’t distracted by some duppy wondering past. My boys would come here to meet their friends even after we moved. The youth center entrance is around the side.

Ready for a song:
I’m going to meet a giantess

She holds the key to my heart
She holds the key to my heart. 
She holds the key to my heart 
She holds the key she holds the key. 


You’ll find her and me on a street named before naming 
Or an Irish playwright goaled.

Sorry, friend. “Josie” pull yourself together.

Focus – Josie. I am a Duppy Hunter. 

A new barbershop. On your left. 

We would sit for hours and wait as Mr Trim would cut hair. 
I can’t even remember what was here before. 

The street’s so different now. There was a garage, where Dad would get his car fixed,the motor	bike shop. The flats opposite look like they landed from out of space. Sealed in. 

That’s Argyle Road on the left. Dad said there were parties on Argyle going back to the 60s. Carnival time the sound system would play some of the best reggae and dub. 

You skank? Do you know what skanking is?

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Wilder Street like Grosvenor was thriving. Working, hanging, hustling, living. It’s so quiet. 
Wilder Street tells you want you need to know about how the Beast Master treats St Paul’s - raids then regeneration. New funds, new faces. Some worked, some withered, some stalled. 
So where is this giantess. 
The charities do the best they can. See opposite - the carpark -that’s the night shelter. Mumma would always pass by the shelter on her midnight round. She said the people in the shelter were easy pickings for wicked duppies. 
 
<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Scatter Duppies scatter. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
I wish I had Mumma’s strength. I had to go. I had to. I can conquer duppies but the Beast Master is the real problem. I don’t have the Power to conquer him. 
Where is this giantess?


<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span> 
She holds the key to my heart. 
She holds the key to my heart
Keys.
Now look up and down the street carefully
Where could she be?
A) Inside the carpark waiting for charity
B) Sitting in a garden shop window among the leaves
C) Looking down from above One Love....

Open you eyes and see. 	

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Another riddle to solve –  look aroud you -check your phone and choose the right one. Remember I’m with you.

Leroy used to like to have a drink here after working at Docklands. When he moved on, he still came and met his friends here especially Samson – the host. 

Samson made everyone welcome – Black, White, straight, gay, young, student not student.

I can see why Leroy liked to hang out with him. Always He’s an institution like the place itself I was away. I’m sorry Leroy. He stopped off at Cosie’s to borrow the spare keys. He stopped here to meet his brother. He was always forgetting his keys. Leroy thought he was in trouble –but no. He just wanted to get home. He had a tune he wanted to get home and finish. Leroy told him to slow down. 
 
Turn around and cross over the green for me.

Wait. I don’t know if I can. 
 
<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Go on darling. 

Friend join me. Tell her -  

You are a duppy hunter. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
What is it there is a duppy. We’ve found it. 
 
<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> No it’s not what you think.
 
<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span> 
Sometimes the duppy you conquer are your own. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Who are you? 
 
<span class="char-name">Duppy:</span> 
I have eight legs. I spin webs. I was born in Africa, and moved to Europe and the Americas. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
Anansi. 
 
<span class="char-name">Anansi:</span> 
Yes. The duppy you have been chasing is your own fear. 
 
<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Come through duppy Hunter. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Let’s walk through to the center of the path on the green. 

<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
It all makes sense now: why we started at Trinity, the key shop, St Agnes, 7th Day, Docklands.

Jericho is my youngest. Is still my youngest. 

He was in St Paul’s. Finishing a new song with his friend at Docklands. He was in a rush to get home and play it to his girl friend. He left his keys behind and he knew I was at a meeting, son he went to borrow the spare set from his brother Leroy. Jericho was always rushing. He just jumped on the bike.
 
Jericho was always moving so fast– he jumped on his bike and went tearing through the exit towards town he went through the lights at the junction. It wasn’t the drivers fault.
 
<span class="char-name">Leroy:</span>
Flashback Jericho.
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
When Leroy heard the siren, he just knew. He ran to the scene. 
 
<span class="char-name">Leroy:</span>
Flashback Stay with me bro. Stay with me. 
 
<span class="char-name">Josie:</span> 
He saw his brother Jericho and kept talking to him just so he didn’t pass over alone. 
I couldn’t come back after that. I couldn’t. 
We had the funeral at St Agnes. Fada P presiding. 
All that went through my head is if only Leroy wasn’t in, if Simon never liked coming to St Paul’s. Most of all I blamed me. Duppy hunting, committee sitting but can’t protect my own. 

But he was made for adventure. Always flying.
A head full of dreams.I couldn’t protect him. 

Friend, open the salt and pour it over the green. This
memory is my duppy to conquer.

Jericho, I let you go. 
 
Stay with me a moment. 
Can you say this for me. 
Leroy, your mother loves you. 
 
<span class="char-name">Anansi:</span> 
It was the only way we could get you to face up to what happened. Duppy Hunting needs you, Josie. You need you. 

<span class="char-name">Mumma:</span> 
Walk out of the square using the exit facing Circomedia now turn left and walk towards the end of the street. But look out for the blue plaque on the wall. 
Look at your phone. Press reached when you have found it.

Here’s where it all began. Where Mumma met Dad inside the Bamboo club. It was the first establishment where West Indians could go. You saw the most amazing acts there before they became famous ‘Bob Marley’ Jimmy Clif.’ But Dad said it was special because it was the place where he met the only person he wanted to meet in life. 

Owned by a White Jewish man Tony Bullimore married to a Jamaican – it was a sign of hope. We’ll see. 
 
A venue. Back then you couldn’t just go into town, you weren’t wanted. It was easy with the 	boys - no trainers, no hats, - but they still found excuses for us girls. We didn’t like the music anyway. Not back then. It made us have to be a community. It made us come together. 
 
Thank you Anansi.
